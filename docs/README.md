*If you wish to use this guide to rip assets out of the game and use them for your own benefit and not to mod, kindly **piss off***

This is a port of the steam guide with more detail and better formatting. This guide is intended to be for the benefit of other modding communities as well (Blue Fire doesn't have a big enough modding scene to fascilitate this anyway)

**Tools and resources can be found at the bottom**

### The Basics
 - [Decompressing the pak](./The%20Basics/Unpaking/)
 - [Using UEViewer (Umodel) to view and extract assets](./The%20Basics/UEViewer/)
 - [Configuration and packaging in engine](./The%20Basics/Engine/) (example given is for UI or textures)
 - [Final Paking](./Blue-Fire-Modding-Guide/The%20Basics/Paking/)
 
### Specific mod guides
 - [Replacing models](./Specific%20Guides/Models/)
 - [Disabling objects](./Specific%20Guides/Disabling/)
 - [Editing materials](./Specific%20Guides/Materials/)
 - [Text and Dialogue](./Specific%20Guides/Dialogue/)
 - [Replacing levels](./Specific%20Guides/Levels/) (custom maps)-this is thankfully obsolete for blue fire due to the awesome official [void maker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1793350/Blue_Fire_Void_Maker/)!
 ##### Uasset Editing
  - [Using UassetGUI](./Uasset%20Editing/UAssetGUI/)
  - [Using UassetAPI](./Uasset%20Editing/UAssetAPI/)
 
***^ All of these can be used in conjunction with each other in the same pak so feel free to experiment!***
 - [Blueprint modding](./Logic%20Mods/BluePrint/)

# Guides
  - My [steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2564366174) on Blue Fire modding which some sections were copied from (formatting is horrible)
  - [Dmgvol's](https://github.com/Dmgvol) [GRGuides](https://github.com/Dmgvol/GR_Guides) which covers a lot of what is covered here (this guide was based on this)
  - [atenfyr's](https://github.com/atenfyr) [astroneer modder's guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/193p6thlTOWffF-JIeTGrLUHg9Um5i6gwMJaK4kzy9Ik) which is relevant ignoring the astroneer specific parts
  - [Buckminsterfullerene's](https://github.com/Buckminsterfullerene02) BP tutorials for DRG - relevant from 3 onwards
  - [DRG modding](https://github.com/Buckminsterfullerene02/DRG-Modding/) is a collection of DRG guides and tools by [Buckminsterfullerene](https://github.com/Buckminsterfullerene02)
  - [GHFear's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRg7RCAoE_3jjibix9Ggwaw/featured) BP guides - specific to RusselJ's modloader
  - [Spyro Reignited](https://franklygd.github.io/Spyro-Reignited-Trilogy-Asset-Replacement/) modding guide
  - [Satisfactory modding guide](https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/index.html) is specific, but a lot can be learnt from it
  - [UE4 documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/) is useful for those newer to the engine
### Discords
 *in order of relevance*
  - [Blue Fire](https://discord.gg/q4ydWSG) is the official server for blue fire! There is a modding channel and a tools and resources channel which is basically this section of the guide
  - [UE modding](https://discord.gg/zVvsE9mEEa) is a small server aiming to pull together and gather tools and knowledge of UE modding - good if you want extra tools or more code related questions
  - [Ghostrunner modding](https://discord.gg/eZRz3Q5) is the combined modding and speedrunning server for Ghostrunner. Ghostrunner is made in the same version of unreal so is very relevant
  - [DRG modding](https://discord.gg/3EVUQjz8N5) is the modding server for Deep Rock Galactic - also made in the same version of UE and is very active due to it's native modding support
  - [Code Vein and Scarlet nexus modding](https://discord.gg/VvfvWn9) is very useful for guides
  - [Bloodstained modding](https://discord.gg/b9XBH4f) is the modding server for the Bloodstained games
  
  Extra discords can be found in [UE modding](https://discord.gg/zVvsE9mEEa)
