# Blueprint mods

- Blueprint mods use a modloader to inject blueprint (Unreal's visual scripting system) into a game
- This allows addition of custom logic and events

- Download the [Universal Unreal Modloader](https://github.com/RussellJerome/UnrealModLoader/releases/) by [RusselJ](https://github.com/RussellJerome)
- This will contain a .exe, some .dlls and some .profile files
